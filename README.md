# NeoPixel Candle
### NeoPixel LED candle programmed with CircuitPython. Perfect for a Halloween Pumpkin! :jack_o_lantern:

This code needs the CircuitPython NeoPixel Library in order to function. [You can get the CircuitPython library bundle by clicking here](). Copy the `neopixel.mpy` file in the `lib` folder into the `lib` folder in your CircuitPython board and you should be good to go! If there is no `lib` folder in your CircuitPython board, create one. :grin:

The code is configured for a Raspberry Pi Pico with a [8mm NeoPixel LED]() connected to the GP16 pin. Adjust the setings for your setup by editing the code!
