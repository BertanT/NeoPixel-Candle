# NeoPixel Candle
### NeoPixel LED candle programmed with CircuitPython. Perfect for a Halloween Pumpkin! :jack_o_lantern:
## ðŸ‘€ Overview
This code needs the CircuitPython NeoPixel Library in order to function. [You can get the CircuitPython library bundle by clicking here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Copy the `neopixel.mpy` file in the `lib` folder into the `lib` folder in your CircuitPython board and you should be good to go! If there is no `lib` folder in your CircuitPython board, create one. :grin:

The code is configured for a Raspberry Pi Pico with a [8mm NeoPixel LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1734) connected to the GP16 pin. Adjust the setings for your setup by editing the code!
